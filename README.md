### Writing a game in pyvida ###

Please refer to the documentation in pyvida/docs

#### Empty Project ####

```
    app = Game(name="basic project", fullscreen=False)
    app.init()  # initialise sound and graphics
    app.run()  # start the event loop
```

#### Game with one scene ####
```
    app = Game(name="basic project", fullscreen=False)

    scene = Scene("main interface")
    app.add(scene)
    app.camera.scene(scene)  # set the camera to the scene

    app.init()  # initialise sound and graphics
    app.run()  # start the event loop
```


### Developer ###

You can contribute to pyvida by cloning the github repository.

To make a scripting event, on your class add a:

def on_<event>(self) method.
    self.busy += 1 # to make the event block the next event for that actor
    self.game._waiting = True  # to make the event block all other events in the game.



### Tests ###
